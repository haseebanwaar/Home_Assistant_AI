**Description:**
Towards Agents-based Home and Personal Assistant AI (LLM, VLM, Omni)

## Overview
Home Assistant AI is an initiative to develop a next-generation, agents-based system for home and personal assistant functionality. This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and omnidirectional capabilities to create a versatile, intelligent, and adaptive assistant.

## Goals
1. **Intelligent Agents**: Develop modular agents for specific tasks (e.g., scheduling, reminders, home automation).
2. **Multimodal Interactions**: Utilize both language and vision capabilities for rich, context-aware interactions.
3. **Personalization**: Adapt to individual user preferences and habits over time.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Work across various platforms and devices.
